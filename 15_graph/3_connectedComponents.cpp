/*
Connected Components in an Undirected Graph:
This code finds the number of connected components in an undirected graph using Depth First Search (DFS).
Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited array and recursion stack.
